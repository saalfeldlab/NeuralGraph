# Experiments on flyvis data using latent evolution model

# Voltage

## Time step 1

We start with fly_N9_62_1 & model voltage at the simulated 20ms time step resolution.

TODO:

- [ ] add stimulus
- [ ] make diagnostic plots
- [ ] are we doing better than predicting a constant
- [ ] sweep parameters
